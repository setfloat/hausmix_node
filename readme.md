# Hausmix

Hausmix is a house management software designed for shared housemates and families. This initial implementation is targeted for housemates and shared chores.

Hausmix helps with scheduling chores and incentivizing their completion through an innovative monetary reward system. Hausmix aims to alleviate tensions and reduce household conflict by having a flexible approach to chore management in shared homes. If your shared home is a mess, maybe it is time to mix in a new approach to how you keep your house tidy.
